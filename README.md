**CYMS** is designed for effortless creation of menus on the **Cheap Yellow Display (CYD)**, offering a rich set of functions and an easy-to-use API.
Built on top of the high-performance **bb_spi_lcd** display driver, CYMS takes advantage of **bb_spi_lcd's** optimizations, making it ideal for the **CYD**.
This library has all the features of **bb_spi_lcd** like:
- displaying **Windows format BMP files**
- **built-in touch** support for the CYD
- **backbuffer (RAM) operations** for smooth UI renering

CYMS provides a good looking and snappy interface for various functions for the CYD.
